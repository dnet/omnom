== Federation thoughts ==

 - Server A and Server B want to federate. Admins add each others public key to their DB.
 - Each server maintains an escrow set
 - When a new bookmark comes in to server A, it chooses one (or more) of its friends
    at random and escrows a copy of the bookmark to there.


 Questions:
    - How do servers protect their user information?
